#  Laudspeaker PostHog Plugin

## Why use PostHog and Laudspeaker?

Laudspeaker is an open source omnichannel customer messaging SaaS. It is an alternative to Braze, Iterable, customer io and many many other options. Its designed to be developer friendly and easy to use. And you can use our journey tool to easily create event-triggered, or time triggered user notifications. 

PostHog is open source product analytics so we can go hand in hand! We believe we are the easiest tool to use with PostHog to set things up like automated  onboarding emails. If a user completes an action in PostHog, have an automated message reach them when, where and how you want!

 - provide `[your_server's_url]/events/posthog` for `Lauspeaker URL` (or if using our hosted plan just use `app.laudspeaker.com/events/posthog`). The other fields (email, phone number, custom) are optional and can be specified if you want to be able to message people from PostHog through those channels with laudspeaker 
 
 - Then enable the plugin and you should start seeing events sent to laudspeaker.
